      <description>DISCLAIMER: This is intending to be a learning exercise and may not be the most efficient way to do things. This is intended to be a multi-part blog post describing how to create a recommender gRPC service in Go.
In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to cover how to define a contract between a client and a server using gRPC. gRPC is an open source Remote Procedure Call framework, it uses protocol buffers as the description language.</description>

      <description>Written using Go 1.14.6 on a Mac.
From time to time it&amp;rsquo;s important to be able to tell certain metadata about exactly what is running. A couple important use cases may be; injecting the commit SHA to know exactly what code is running; injecting the build time to know how old the build is; and many more!
Introducing ldflags! It allows us to inject compile time information into our binaries. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at a small example.</description>
