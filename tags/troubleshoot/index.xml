Kubernetes is hard. I thought I understood kubernetes; I had provisioned clusters from scratch, I had installed istio and a whole bunch of other tools, I had fixed outages in the past. I then joined a organisation whose expertise were kubernetes, and oh boy did I have a lot to learn.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t a blog post of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, I think that&amp;rsquo;s a useless post, it&amp;rsquo;d be irrelevant in 3 weeks.</description></item></channel></rss>
