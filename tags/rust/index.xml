I&amp;rsquo;ve been away for a while, I took a career break and got a dog. I rejoined the working world in January.
In that time I also began learning Rust in depth. I had dabbled with it before, but I wanted to learn it properly. I didn&amp;rsquo;t/don&amp;rsquo;t expect it to replace my love of Go, maybe I can use both in the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
