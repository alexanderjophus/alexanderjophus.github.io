We stopped at the point of being able to run it locally, in our specific use case we were able to search through a list of Digimon, and even get specific Digimon by name.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll be deploying the application through shuttle. ðŸš€
As a recap, here&amp;rsquo;s where we are:</description></item><item><title>Creating a full stack web app in Rust 1/3</title><link>https://example.com/posts/rust-full-stack-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 18:49:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/posts/rust-full-stack-1/</guid><description>Intro Link to heading For those that know me or read the last blog post, you&amp;rsquo;ll know Rust has become my new favourite (I&amp;rsquo;m sorry Go, I still love you). In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll be creating a full stack web app in Rust, using a few libraries I&amp;rsquo;ve come to love, and deploying it super super cheap.

In that time I also began learning Rust in depth. I had dabbled with it before, but I wanted to learn it properly. I didn&amp;rsquo;t/don&amp;rsquo;t expect it to replace my love of Go, maybe I can use both in the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
