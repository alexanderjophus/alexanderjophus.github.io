I&amp;rsquo;m going to create a few separate sections, such as kubernetes, REST, gRPC, etc. The list is by no means complete; I&amp;rsquo;m always on the lookout for new tools to play with so if I missed something, let me know and I&amp;rsquo;ll happily update this list. It&amp;rsquo;s probably important to date this post, so read the date and with that we&amp;rsquo;ll get on.</description></item><item><title>MAKING THE JUMP TO GRAPHQL (Formula 1 API)</title><link>/posts/graphql/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 17:31:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/graphql/</guid><description>Catch the streams over on my twitch

Intro Say you have a rest API and for argument sake, it&amp;rsquo;s a very RESTful implementation of a formula 1 API. You can get a list of current constructors in the standings, it provides all the information about all the constructors (or bonus points you can specify the constructor you want and retrieve just that one).</description></item><item><title>INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE (Pulumi + Go)</title><link>/posts/pulumi-gke/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 17:30:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pulumi-gke/</guid><description>Intro So you&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the cloud for a bit, you&amp;rsquo;ve been fiddling with some dials, deploying some new services, and flipping some switches. Production is running smoothly. You get the new requirements to spin up a staging environment so you can test changes before they get into production. Cool. Wait, how did we set up prod again?
Introducing the concept Infrastructure as Code, in short this allows you to commit your infrastructure to your version control system.</description></item><item><title>ADDING MIDDLEWARE TO A gRPC GO SERVICE</title><link>/posts/middleware/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 11:17:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/middleware/</guid><description>WARNING: This space is moving very fast, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep this project/blog up to date.
Intro Let&amp;rsquo;s start by asking some questions about our service;
What was the error that caused a failure? What percentage of calls are successful? Where did our service spend most of its time/what can we optimise? Deploying a service without any logging/metrics/traces is going to cause frustration when answering these questions.
What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to answer these questions?</description></item><item><title>4/4 CREATING A ML CLASSIFIER GRPC SERVICE WITH GOLANG (finishing the project)</title><link>/posts/ml-grpc-4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 18:37:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/ml-grpc-4/</guid><description>DISCLAIMER: This is intending to be a learning exercise and may not be the most efficient way to do things. This is intended to be a multi-part blog post describing how to create a recommender gRPC service in Go.

Intro We&amp;rsquo;ll update our server to load the theta.bin model we created in post 3. We&amp;rsquo;ll update the Predict function to use the model in the server.</description></item><item><title>3/4 CREATING A ML CLASSIFIER GRPC SERVICE WITH GOLANG (creating a model)</title><link>/posts/ml-grpc-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 10:37:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/ml-grpc-3/</guid><description>DISCLAIMER: This is intending to be a learning exercise and may not be the most efficient way to do things.

Intro In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to create a model using gorgonia. We will be following the iris tutorial mostly, just changing a few bits here and there for our use case.</description></item><item><title>2/4 CREATING A ML CLASSIFIER GRPC SERVICE WITH GOLANG (implementing a server)</title><link>/posts/ml-grpc-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 15:37:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/ml-grpc-2/</guid><description>DISCLAIMER: This is intending to be a learning exercise and may not be the most efficient way to do things.

Intro In this section we&amp;rsquo;re going to implement a gRPC service and test it via manual external tools evans.
Setting up For this we will ignore all machine learning and just get our server returning a random iris classification.</description></item><item><title>1/4 CREATING A ML CLASSIFIER GRPC SERVICE WITH GOLANG (the gRPC bit)</title><link>/posts/ml-grpc-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 15:37:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/ml-grpc-1/</guid><description>Edited 05/11/2021: Uses buf for proto generation/linting

We will also generate code through buf.</description></item><item><title>ADDING COMPILE TIME INFORMATION TO YOUR GO BINARIES</title><link>/posts/using-ldflags/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 15:51:31 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/using-ldflags/</guid><description>From time to time it’s important to be able to tell certain metadata about exactly what is running. A couple important use cases may be; injecting the commit SHA to know exactly what code is running; injecting the build time to know how old the build is; and many more!
Introducing ldflags! It allows us to inject compile time information into our binaries. Let’s take a quick look at a small example.</description></item></channel></rss>
