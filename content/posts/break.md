I'm taking a small break to focus on health, wellbeing, and hopefully getting a puppy.

I'll tinker with some things from time to time, but it won't be consistent.

I'll still be running the [Bristol Gophers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/golang-bristol/). I'll have some time to mentor people, so if you're interested in learning Go, please reach out.

All the best folks, see you soon.
